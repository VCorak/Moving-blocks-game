This is just example of game witch I made with random moving sprite by mouse on canvas. Used some of code for my Alien attack game (moving-blocks-game).

Really like the constructor in javasript and would love to improve this game with time. I have a lot o comments in script.js file inside the code but that really helps me to understand what is going on and why it has to go like that. Still have a lot of strugle with understanding how framework with and height works, it is some kind of weird piece of code which I found on youtube tutorial made of percentage thing dividing with 10...OMG!!! :) but will try to understand it better. Also piece of code with collision thing...this is something out of this world for me...but it works apparently, need a lot of exploring here. 
In this game also have a bit trouble with adjusting the sprites frames so they look more natural while walking...do not have photoshop for that, just used Sprite Sheet Picker https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer where you can adjust frames in horizontal line and have them look like animated... Also used this usefull site for flipping images https://onlinepngtools.com/flip-png-horizontally Flip PNG Horizontally to have sprites look and walk in game direction.
